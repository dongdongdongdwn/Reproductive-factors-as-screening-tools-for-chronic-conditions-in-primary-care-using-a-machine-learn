Autoencoder
When activation function is sigmoid, learning rate is 0.001,optimizer is Adamoptimizer, the training process is faster and more stable.
n_layer1/2/3 could be changed as you want. However, sparse does not work well.

'autoencoder3_revise.py' is python file and '10 variables.xlsx" is the dataset.
This seperated dataset is only for you to try the code. Commericial use is permitted. Thank you very much.
