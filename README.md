Autoencoder;

By greedy search, the costs of the autoencoder were listed for different hyper-parametres combinations;
The results showed that, when activation function is sigmoid, learning rate is 0.001,optimizer is Adamoptimizer, the training process is faster and more stable. n_layer1/2/3 at 8/5/3 could yiled the best results.However, sparse does not work well.

'10 variables.xlsx" is the dataset which only contains the 10 clinical biomarkers of all original participants before exclusion, so as to provent from individual identification. This seperated dataset is only for you guys to test the code. Commericial use is not permitted. Thank you very much.
